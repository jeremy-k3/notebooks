The Technology Opportunities Symposium engages a broad \\naudience of academia, government and industry from Australia and like-\\nminded international partners. The Technology Opportunities Symposium \\nwill feature a diverse range of expert presentations and facilitated \\nimmersive workshops to draw key insights on the subject areas.

Information\\nQuantum Computing Functionality\\nOur computational ability is fundamentally limited by the laws of \\nnature. Quantum computing, as the name implies, exploits the more \\nfundamental laws of quantum mechanics to gain computational \\nadvantage. In our everyday lives the fundamental quantum laws of nature \\nare hidden from us as quantum phenomena usually only occur within \\nvery small distances and/or time scales. The main reason for this is that \\nwe have not been able to control interaction of quantum systems with \\ntheir environment up until recently. When quantum systems interact with \\ntheir environment, a phenomenon of decoherence occurs which washes \\nout uniquely quantum behaviour. We are now able to control interaction of \\nquantum systems with their environment, which has opened the door to \\nfull exploitation of quantum mechanical phenomena for computing. This \\nability is at the heart of the so-called second quantum revolution.\\nThe fundamental logical unit or bit for quantum computing is the \\nquantum bit or qubit. The qubit represents a quantum logical unit using \\na two-state quantum system. While a classical bit can take on values \\nof 0 or 1, a two-level quantum system can take on a combination, or in \\nthe language of quantum mechanics, a superposition of both logical \\nstates. The combination or superposition of the two quantum states of \\na qubit is specified by amplitudes for each of the logical states. When \\nan observation of a qubit is made, we cannot tell which state will be \\nobserved, but we can calculate the probability of observing them. The \\nprobability of observation of a particular state of the qubit is the square of \\nthe magnitude of the amplitude of that logical state.\\nOne way we can represent a qubit in a superposition state is as a point \\non the surface of a sphere, usually referred to as a Bloch sphere. In this \\nrepresentation, a quantum state equivalent to the logical 0 corresponds \\nto the North Pole, and a quantum state equivalent to the logical 1 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='de9c4274-b0cf-47a9-812d-d52d1d655680', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '59', 'file_name': 'quantum.pdf', 'file_path': 'quantum.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1962431, 'creation_date': '2024-03-12', 'last_modified_date': '2022-07-25'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='QUANTUM COMPUTING  \\nINSIGHTS PAPER59corresponds to the South Pole. Unlike a classical computer we can \\nprepare a qubit in a state on the equator of the sphere. In this quantum \\nstate, the qubit is for computational purposes in both logical states at the \\nsame time with equal probability.\\nWhat exactly does this superposition property of a qubit mean in terms of \\ncomputational power? If we set the qubit state to a point on the equator \\nof the sphere, then any operation carried out on the qubit will be carried \\nout on both logical 0 and logical 1 values simultaneously.\\nSo far, we have only talked about a single qubit. If we have n of these \\nqubits, each in a superposition state and undertaking an operation, then \\nwe effectively undertake 2 x 2 x ‚Ä¶ x 2 (n times), which is 2n calculations in \\nparallel. This parallelism is central to quantum computational power.\\nIn order to undertake an arbitrary calculation, we need to be able to \\nundertake single qubit operations. That is, be able to change the state \\nof each qubit and move it to an arbitrary position on the surface of the \\nsphere we use to represent its state. In addition we need at least one type \\nof two qubit operation. With these, any quantum computer program can \\nin principle be run. Two qubit operations mix information between qubits \\nand often result in what is referred to as an entangled quantum state. In \\nessence, the two qubits after interaction are no longer independent, hence \\nthe name entanglement. As a result, properties observed for one qubit in \\nthe pair instantaneously determine what will be measured in the other.\\nUp to this point we have outlined a process which provides exponential \\nparallelism. However in quantum mechanics we can only ever observe \\none of the possible final states in a computation. That is, although we \\nhave undertaken 2n calculations, we can only observe one of the possible \\noutcomes. To make matters worse, we don‚Äôt know which answer we \\nwill observe. Fortunately, we usually only want one of these answers. \\nAs an example, we might want to find the entry in a data base which is \\nthe closest fit to a particular input.

Quantum logic gates are \\nsimilar in concept to logical gates in classical computing, although they \\nfunction differently to utilise quantum system properties.

This method translates a function into \\nbiases and couplers to change the energy states of qubits and create \\nentanglement.7 The qubits will then return to their minimum energy \\nstate, or one close to it, to represent the solution (the global minimum) to \\nthe optimisation problem. Problems framed as energy minimisation can \\nbe solved using quantum annealing with a high probability. \\nQuantum annealing is more error tolerant than gate models and \\ncan extract results even with significant quantum noise.

Fault tolerant systems require significant \\nresources to produce logical qubits (defined below) and perform logic \\ngates. In addition, the computational overheads required for their \\nimplementation can significantly reduce their prospective benefit. \\nThere are many issues around quantum software development and \\ncompiling, such as, which processor does what, when and how?

              "      <td>22<br>EMERGING DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY  <br>ASSESSMENT SYMPOSIUMDespite being at a relatively early stage of development, some argue <br>that quantum computing has already changed computer science. For <br>example, quantum computing has stimulated debates in computing and <br>information sciences as to whether Alan Turing‚Äôs (computational) model <br>of what a computer is ‚Äì which is what we have in the form of classical <br>computers ‚Äì is the most complete model of what computing could be or <br>should be. With the advent of the quantum computing model it is now <br>apparent that this is not the case, especially if you take efficiencies into <br>account. Quantum computing is a more general model for modelling <br>information and how information sciences work. It is considered more <br>accurate and more tied to the physical world than what has been used <br>before. As such, quantum computing has contested previous thinking <br>regarding information and computing theory.<br>Many envisage quantum computing as a means to augment classical <br>computers, not to replace them. Indeed, there will be a symbiosis. <br>Development in quantum computing will improve classical computers <br>e.g. classical computer programmers have derived better algorithms <br>for classical computers from quantum algorithms. As such, classical <br>computers will become more powerful alongside quantum computers. <br>In some ways quantum computers are analogous to the turbo in a motor <br>car, where it isn‚Äôt needed all the time, but operates when it is required to <br>enhance performance. Stand-alone quantum computers will also require <br>classical computers to operate them.<br>In the coming years impacts from quantum computing may be seen in <br>investment portfolio optimisation from financial institutions and other <br>entities seeking high risk, but high pay off ventures. Similarly, impacts <br>may be seen in encryption for secure transactions, which can potentially <br>be offset by the upgrading to post quantum cryptography, but as quantum <br>computing hardware emerges this will need to be continually monitored. <br>Changes could be seen in the landscape of industry, from advanced <br>manufacturing through to increased simulation capability, the study of <br>new molecules within health sciences, improvements in robotics and <br>autonomous systems, or new, currently unknown industries could emerge.</td>\n",
